# PROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT OF A MICROCONTROLLER-BASED GREENHOUSE MONITORING SYSTEM WITH VISUAL SMS ALERTS

🌿 Project OverviewThis project is a research-based prototype designed to automate greenhouse environment
monitoring. Using an Arduino Uno, the system tracks ambient temperature, humidity, and soil 
chemistry (NPK, pH, EC). If environmental conditions exceed safety thresholds, the system 
triggers Visual Alerts via onboard LEDs and sends a Critical SMS Alert via the SIM800L GSM module.

## 💻 Software Setup
1. Required Libraries
Install these via the Arduino IDE Library Manager (Ctrl+Shift+I):

DHT sensor library by Adafruit

LiquidCrystal I2C by Frank de Brabander

SoftwareSerial (Built-in)

ModbusMaster (For the RS485 Probe)

2. Arduino IDE Configuration
Connect your Arduino Uno via the USB Type A to B cable [MLE01112].

Go to Tools > Board and select Arduino Uno.

Go to Tools > Port and select the COM port (e.g., COM3).

### 🧪 Testing Procedures
Step 1: GSM Network Test
Before uploading the full code, ensure your SIM800L is registered:

Insert a micro-SIM card (ensure it has load/balance).

Power the module. The Blue LED should blink.

Success: A slow blink (once every 3 seconds) means it is connected to the network.

Step 2: Serial Monitor Debugging
Open the sms-alert.ino file.

Input your mobile number in the PHONE_NUMBER variable.

Click Upload (Arrow icon).

Open the Serial Monitor (Ctrl+Shift+M) at 9600 baud.

Watch the readings. If you blow on the DHT22 sensor to increase heat, look for the "Sending SMS..." message in the monitor.

Step 3: Visual Confirmation
Green LED: Should stay lit when parameters are normal.

Red LED: Should blink when an SMS is being transmitted.

LCD: Check if the text is clear. If not, turn the small blue potentiometer on the back of the I2C module to adjust contrast.

### ⚠️ Critical Safety Notes
Power Supply: The SIM800L V2 and the RS485 Probe should be powered by a 5V 2A or 12V adapter (depending on the probe specs). Powering everything through the Arduino USB port alone may cause the GSM module to fail during SMS transmission.

Grounding: Ensure all components share a Common Ground (GND) to prevent data corruption.
